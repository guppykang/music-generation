0.7 temperature seems to work the best for music generation. Generate music by converting to legitmate musical notation at : http://mandolintab.net/abcconverter.php 

LSTM Model with 100 hidden units and 1 hidden layer seems to converge around 1.5 - 1.6. 
Rnn model with 150 hidden units and 1 hidden layer seems to converge around 1.9 - 2.0

RNN implementation included in addition to the LSTM. RNN is only slightly worse than the LSTM (expected).
